Project Goal / Problem to solve: When using mobile devices, the capability of having a text prediction can help the user type words faster with greater accuracy. Two key metrics for this capability to be successful will involve accuracy and prediction speed. 

Based on a set of data provided by Swiftkey containing both twitter (lazy typers), blogs and news in four different languages. We have set out to build a fast and accurate prediction app that will predict the next word in a given sentence.

The " Swiftkey word Prediction" app is our answer to the problem.
